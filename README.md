<h1>Hi there, My name is Mthunzi Sidwell Tom ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    I am currently learning fullstack development. I am looking for opportunities in coding. 
    One fact that made me fell in love with coding is the fact that it is challenging and when I started learning coding
    I did not get it at first try so that pushed me to learn and outworked my potential.
    Fun fact: Collaboration is the best thing about coding.
